# Fundamental-Analysis
Applying machine learning to random combinations of historical fundamentals of stocks to find alpha and predict future gains

Note: The data used is provided by simfin and is delayed for a year unless you purchase their subscription. The last cell is predicting on last year's data, which offers somewhat of a backtest, but to be usable, one needs to purchase a subscription.

Observations: Simfin's data is amazing for what it is, freememium, but is missing a ton of data. It does its best for survivorship bias, but is flawed in my code
